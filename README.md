Bioinformatics Project

This Bioinformatic project I used python based bioinformatic pipeline, I processed real CFTR genetic variant data and cleaned the data, analyze the data then summarize to find what kind of variants exist and how common they are in the population.

This project answers how many CFTR variants are there, what type of variants are most common and how common the variants are in humans and how large is the CFTR Protein? 
I used 2 files one is protein file and another dataset consists of variants. The first file consists of 1480 amino acids and the second file consists of 4616 different variants. 

These are the results from the pipeline. 
variant_types breakdown

coding_substitution : 2903
intronic_or_splice  : 908
deletion            : 430
duplication         : 111
cdna_other          : 40
insertion           : 13

From the results most of the variants are coding substitution and intronic or splice variants. insertion, deletion, duplication and cdna_other are less common. The average population frequency of CFTR variants was low, indicating that most variants are rare in the human population. This analysis demonstrates how raw clinical variant data can be transformed into biologically meaningful insights.
